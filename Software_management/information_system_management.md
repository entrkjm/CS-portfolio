## Software Development Methodologies
### Definition
Methodology for software development is a set of workflow techniques and methods used in software solutions.

### Types 
- Structural approach (1970s)
- Information engineering methodology
- Object-orientd methodology -> Reusable Part
- CBD : Component Based Design -> Module Focused
- Agile : Flexibility

### 3 elements of Project Management
- People : Human resource
- Problem : Definition and clarification of problem
- Process : Planning on process

### Risk analysis
:Software risk analysis in software development is a systematic process that involves identifying and evaluating any problem that might happen during the creation, 
implementation, and maintaining of software systems. 
It can guarantee that projects are finished on schedule, within budget, and with the appropriate quality. It is a crucial component of software development.

#### steps 
- Identify hazards
- Assess the risks
- Control the risks
- Record your findings
- Review the controls

## Software Measurement Metrics (Cost Estimation)
### Correlation between required cost and total period
- The shorter the period is, the higher the cost gets as more human resources are required.

### Examples in Techniques of Forecasting (Cost Estimation)
- Delphi technique : The Delphi Technique is a decision-making process that involves a group of experts providing their opinions and insights on a particular topic or problem.
- LOC(Lines of Code) : Simple technique to assess a program's size.
- COCOMO(Constructive Cost Model) : Cost estimation using LOC
   - Types: Organic, Semi-Detached, Embedded
